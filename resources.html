            <p>The website created by a group called ‘Delete Cyberbullying’ needs to be acknowledged, due to its similarity with our project. This website aims to educate people about cyberbullying through many different methods, such as news about cyberbullying, social media guides, news, etc. (Delete Cyberbullying) While this website is similar to the project that we aim to create which may serve as a model, this website lacks proper design that can lead people to access the features inside the webpage. The links on the main page have been expired or removed, the news has not been updated from 2021, and the navigation bars look complicated for most users to use. We aim to create a simple, updated, and more accessible website that will be more user-friendly, and educate people about cyberbullying more effectively. We hope to impact people in not only the UW community but also people in the world so we can stop cyberbullying adequately.
